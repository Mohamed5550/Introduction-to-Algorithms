# Proving that it Activity-Selection problem can be solving by selecting the last starting time instead of first finishing time

Suppose that `K` is tha max-set of the set `S`

now let `a` is the last starting element of `K`

and `b` is the last starting element of `S`

We want to prove that $K - a\ \cup b$ is a max-set

let `c` is the second last starting element in K

let `sa` is the starting time of `a`, `sb` is the staring time of `b` and `sc` is the starting time of `c`.

It is correct if $sa > sc$

But $sa > sb$ and $sb > sc$ because of the sortting by starting time.

So $sa > sc$

Proof is completed
