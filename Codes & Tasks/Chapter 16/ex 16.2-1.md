# Prove that the fractional knapsack problem has the greedy-choice property

let the set be sorted by vi/wi in decresing order

let the best amount be `K`
let the cheapest 1 unit of weight in `K` be `a`
let the most valuable unit of weight outside `K` is `b`

now we assume that $K - a \cup b$ is greater than `K`

but `a` is greater than `b` becase of the sorting

Contradiction
