# Suppose that in a 0-1 knapsack problem, the order of the items when sorted by increasing weight is the same as their order when sorted by decreasing value. Give an efﬁcient algorithm to ﬁnd an optimal solution to this variant of the knapsack problem, and argue that your algorithm is correct

## Solution

It seems that all weights are the same
Just sort them by value in decreasing order and take the first accepted ones until the knapsack can't take more

## Proof

Let `V` is the best answer

Let `K` is better than `V` where $K = V - x \cup y$. Where `x` is the smallest value in `K` and `y` is the biggest value in the rest of the array

value of `x` is greater than `y` because it is in a previous order

A contradiction
