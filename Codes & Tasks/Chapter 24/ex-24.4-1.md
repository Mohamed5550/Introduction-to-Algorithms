# Solution to Ex-24.4-1

By running Bellmand-Ford Algorithms on this graph

suppose that v0 is the vertix 7

    7 16
    2 1 1
    4 1 -4
    3 2 2
    5 2 7
    6 2 5
    6 3 10
    2 4 2
    1 5 -1
    4 5 3
    3 6 -8
    7 1 0
    7 2 0
    7 3 0
    7 4 0
    7 5 0
    7 6 0

We get this solution: -5 -3 0 -1 -6 -8 0
