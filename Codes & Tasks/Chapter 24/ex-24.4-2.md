# Solution to Ex-24.4-2

By running Bellmand-Ford Algorithms on this graph

suppose that v0 is the vertix 6

    6 14
    2 1 4
    5 1 5
    4 2 -6
    2 3 1
    1 4 3
    3 4 5
    5 4 10
    3 5 -4
    4 5 -8
    6 1 0
    6 2 0
    6 3 0
    6 4 0
    6 5 0 

We get false, which means there is a negative cycle.
That means there is no feasible solution to this system
