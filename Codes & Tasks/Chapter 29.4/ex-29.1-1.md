# Getting 3 values for the linear programm

- by drawing the equations on a 2D cartesial plane we get the feasible area
- Then we draw the line of objective
- Feasible solutions are
  - x1=5, x2=2, objective value = $-2(5)+3(2)=-4$
  - x1=4, x2=3, objective value = $-2(4)+3(3)=1$
  - x1=6, x2=1, objective value = $-2(6)+3(1)=-9$
