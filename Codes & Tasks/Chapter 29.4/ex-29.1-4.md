# Show that the linear program is unbounded

- Suppose that $x_0, y_0$ are the optimal solution
- now let's try feasability test for $x_0+1, y_0$
  - $-2(x_0+1) + y_0 \lt -2x_0 + y_0 \le -1$
  - $-(x_0+1) - 2y_0 \lt -x_0+ - 2y_0 \le-2$
  - $x_0+1 \gt x_0 \ge 0$
- A contradiction, then there cannot be an optimal solution
