# Prove that there are infnitely many primes

let $X_k$ be a number equals $2*3*5*....*P_k+1$, where $P_k$, is the $k_{th}$ prime number

Now we know that each composite number between $2$ and $P_k$ has at least one prime divisor between $2$ and $P_k$

Then $X_k$ has a composite divisor between $2$ and $P_k$ if and only if it has a prime divisor between $2$ and $P_k$

each of the numbers $2, 3, 5...P_k$ $divides$ $X_k-1$, then 2 will divide $(X_k-1)+2$, 3 will divide $(X_k-1) + 3$, and so on for all primes until $P_k$

But none of them will divide $(X_k - 1) + 1$

Then no primes divides $X_k$ and no composites divides $X_k$, Then $X_k$ is prime
