# Prove that for all positive integers $n, a, b$, if $n \mid ab$ and $gcd(a, n) = 1$, then $n \mid b$

let $S$ be the set of divisors of $b$

and $T$ the set of divisors of $n$

and $U$ the set of divisors of $a$

then $T \in S \cup U$

but $T \cap U = {1}$

then all other divisors of $n$ are also divisors of $b$, or more formally $T \in S$
