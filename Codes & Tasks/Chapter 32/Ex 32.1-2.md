# Question

```text
Suppose that all characters in the pattern P are different. Show how to accelerate
NAIVE-STRING-MATCHER to run in O.n/ time on an n-character text T .
```

## Answer

```text
If all characters are different, then none of the non-first characters can be the first character, then if the first check of the substring failed, the whole substring would fail, so, there is no need to check more than the first character, if it succeeds, continue checking, if not, cancel the whole substring and start with the next substring, this would make the algorithm run in O(n)
```
