# Sets, Etc

## Sets

- A set is a group of distinguishible members
- $x \in S$ means that `x` is a member of `S`, reads `x in S`
- $x \notin S$ means that `x` is not a member of `S`
- Order doesn't matter in sets
- Some special notations
  - $ \phi$ represents the empty set
  - $ Z $ represents the set of integers
  - $ R $ represents the set of real numbers
  - $ N $ represents the natural numbers
- $A \subseteq of B$ means A is a subset of B
- $A = B$ when $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq A$
- Set operations:
  - $A \cap B = \{ x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \}$
  - $A \cup B = \{ x: x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \}$
  - $A - B = \{ x: x \in A \text{ and } x\notin B \}$
- `A` and `B` are `disjoint` when $A \cap B$ = $\phi$
- A collection of sets forms a partition of `B` when
  - The union of all the sets quals B
  - They are disjoint sets
- `Cardinality` is the number of elements in the set $|S|$
- $2^s$ is called the power set of $S$ and includes all the subsets of $S$ including the empty set
- The cartesian products $A \times B$
