What is an Algorithm?
- It is a wel-defined computational model for solving a specified problem (To convert the input into the right output).

NP-complete problems:
- Problems that no one knows if it has aan efficient algorithm or no.
- If you find a solution for one, you can find a solution for the others.

Parallelism:
- It is to use multiple core to increase the number of processes made in the second.
