Data structures
- Programmable sets are such as mathematica sets
- sets that allows inserting, deleting, checking membership are called dictionaries


Operatoins on Dynamic sets:
- queries: getting data
- modifying: setting and editing data



Elementary Data structures:
- Stack
    = LIFO: last in first out
    = inserting: increasing size and adding new element
    = erasing last element: remove element and decreasing size

- Queue:
    = FIFO: first int first out
    = insert (enqueue): 
    = delete (dequeue):
