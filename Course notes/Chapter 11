===== Hash Tables =====


- Direct-address tables:
    = the normal arrays
    = you have to reserve n bytes to store n only

- Hash Tables:
    = Collision: when to keys hashes to the same slot
    = Collision resolving by chaining:
        = simple uniform hasing: the assumption of hashing all elements eually to any of the m slots of the table
    = Hash function
        = The division method: avoid using 2^p or 2^p-1
        = The multiplication method
