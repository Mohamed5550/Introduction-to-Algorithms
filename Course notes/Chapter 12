===== Binary Search Trees =====


- Binary Search Tree Property
    = Every element in the left of x is <= x and every element in the right of x is >= x

- iorder tree walk:
    = A simple recursive algorithm to print the binary search tree in a sorted order

- querying a binary search tree:
    = comparing with left and right child until you get your element
    = you can get the minimum be always getting the left
    = you can get the maximum by always getting the right

- inserting into a binary search tree 
    = we start from the root
    = we go right or left based on the comparison until we find null
    = we set the new node as the right or the left child based on the final comparision with last item
    = we set the last item as parent of the new node

- deleting from a binary search tree
    = case 1: if the left node is null
        == we replace the right node with the parent
    = case 2: if the right node is null
        == we replace the left node
    = case 3: if both are not null
        == get the successor(y) of the node(z) and replace z by y
