Insertion sort:
- Loop fom 1 to the last of the array
- for each element when you reach it, all the elements before it are guaranteed to be sorted
- we call the current element the "key"
- you compare the key with the elements before it, if the key is smaller, you set the value of the current element to the next element of it.
- At last you set the value of last element you reached to the key

What is loop invariant (to prove the correctness of the algorithm like mathematical induction):
- Initialization: It is true for the first iteration of the loop
- Maintance: If it is true before an iteration, it remains true after it.
- Termination: When the loop ends, the code should terminate returning the correct value


== Analyzing Algorithms == 
- It is the calculation of the resources needed for an algorithm
- Operations that is done in constant time: add, subtract, multiply, divide, remainder, floor, ceil, power, shifting.
- running time of an algorithm: the number of steps executed.

Order of growth:
- we simplify the equation of the analysis by taking the most segnificant element (the first term) in the equation (an^2+bn+c: we take n^2).
- It is pronounced theta of n-squared


== Desiging and algorithm ==
The divide-and-conquer approach:
- divide
- conquer
- combine

The merging procedure:
- it is to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array
- it runs in O(n)
