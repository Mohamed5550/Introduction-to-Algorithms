===== Elementart Graph Algorithms =====

Representing a graph:
- adjacency list
- adjacency matrix

==== Breadth first search ====
- the regular BFS approach
- shortest paths

=== Depth first search ===
- discovers every path of the graph until there is no vertices in this graph, then goes to the next path
- no vertix is discovered twice
