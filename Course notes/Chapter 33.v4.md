# Machine-Learning Algorithms

## Introduction

- Machine learning seems to be a subfield of AI
- Machine learning has striong ties with statistics and optimization
- Machine learning is good in tasks that don't need `certainity`
- Machine learning tepically starts with a `learning phase`, followed by a `prediction phase`
- For `online learning`, the learning phase and prediction phase are intermerged

### Supervised learning

- In the training phase, the input is `training data` where each input data point has an associated `label`, the output gives one or more hepotheses about how the labels depend on the attributes of the input data points
- Hypotheses can take many forms, like a formula or an algorithm
- The prediction phase uses the hypotheses on the new data to make prediction about the labels of the new data points

### Unsupervised learning

- The training data is unlabeled
- The hypotheses are made to centers of groups of the input data points

### Reinforcement learning

- The model recieved feedback from the environment and updates itself
