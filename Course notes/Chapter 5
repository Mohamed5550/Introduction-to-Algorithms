Probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms

1. The hrigin problem:
    - We have a person to interview each day for Cn, and if it is the best so far we hire him for Cm
    - The worst case if when they come in increasing order
    - When we have a distribution of the input we can make probabilistic analysis to design an efficient algorithm
    - All of the n! permuations of the applicans have the same probability (uniform random permuation)
    - We can make a fully random permuation instead of relying on the input order

2. Indicator random variables:
    - It is used to simplify the equations of expectations

3. Randomized algorithms:
    - randomly permuted arrays: setting prioritys and sort according to them O(nlogn)
    - Randomize-in-place in O(n)
