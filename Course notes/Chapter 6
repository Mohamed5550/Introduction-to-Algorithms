=== Heap sort ====
There are many sorting algorithms
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort
- Quick sort

Heap sort:
    - depends on heap data structure
    - heap is a binary tree with some constraints
    - max-heap or min-heap
    - max-heap: every element is greater or equal to all of its children
    - heap can be stored in an array
    - left: 2x
    - right 2x+1
    - parent: x/2

Maintaining a heap:
    - It is the method to maintain the current node comparing to its children

Building a heap:
    - We run a max-heapify on each element from n/2 to 1;

Heap sort:
    - We build a heap
    - We run from n to 1;
    - We exchange each root with the ith element in the new range
    - We max-heapify(1) on every itertaion to fix the heap

Priority Queue:
    - Insert(x)
    - top()
    - pop()
    -
