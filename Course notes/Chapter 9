===== Medians and other statistics =====
- the ith order statistics is the ith smallest element
- smallest element is the 1th element
- largest element is the nth element
- median is the (n+1)/2th element (there is lower and upper for even n)

==== Quick select (select the kth smaller element in linear expected time)
- divide the segment into two parts
- get the pivot using quick_sort partition function
- if it is equal to (i) return it
- it i is smaller than the pivor, then recurse in the left segment of the pivot
- else, then recurse in the right segment of the pivot

==== Linear select (Select the kth smaller element in worsc case linear time)
